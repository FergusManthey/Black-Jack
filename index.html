    <h2>RULES</h2>
    <P>In this simplified Blackjack game,
    the goal is to have a score as close to 21 
    as possible without exceeding it. 
    Players can "Hit" to draw more cards or "Stop" to let the dealer play, 
    while the dealer must draw until reaching at least 17.
    The winner is determined by who has the higher score without going over 21, 
    with a tie favoring the dealer.</p>
  
    <p>Start = You and the player get 2 cards with these cards 
        you have to decide whether to press hit or stop
    </p>
    <p>Hit = You get another card but make sure you don't get over 21
    </p>
    <p>Stopp = you finish the game and the dealer also gets cards and if you are lucky you win
    </p>
