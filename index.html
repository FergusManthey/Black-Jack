    <h2>RULES</h2>
    <P>In this simplified Blackjack game,
    the goal is to have a score as close to 21 
    as possible without exceeding it. 
    Players can "Hit" to draw more cards or "Stop" to let the dealer play, 
    while the dealer must draw until reaching at least 17.
    The winner is determined by who has the higher score without going over 21, 
    with a tie favoring the dealer.</P>
